            What is the use of console?<br>

The console window displays a message and waits for you to press a key. Press any key to close the console window and stop debugging.<br>

The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.<br>

How to open it?

If the JavaScript Console window is closed, you can open it while you're debugging in Visual Studio by choosing Debug > Windows > JavaScript Console.<br>

How to print anything on console?<br>

You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print<br> the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.<br>
